# Core Items Used in CQRS

1. _Command_: Represents an intent to change the state of the system (write operation).
2. _Command Handler_: Processes commands and performs the necessary actions to update the state.
3. _Query_: Represents a request to retrieve data (read operation).
4. _Query Handler_: Processes queries and returns the requested data.
5. _Read Model_: Optimized data structure for queries, often denormalized for fast reads.
6. _Write Model_: Data structure used for processing commands and maintaining business logic.
7. _Event_: Represents a change that has occurred in the system, often used with Event Sourcing.
8. _Event Handler_: Reacts to events, updating read models or triggering side effects.
9. _Aggregate_: A cluster of domain objects treated as a single unit for data changes.
10. _Repository_: Provides access to aggregates, typically for the write model.

## More Information About Aggregates (Item 9)

_Aggregate_ is a cluster of related domain objects treated as a single unit for data changes. In Domain-Driven Design (DDD), an aggregate encapsulates business logic and enforces consistency rules within its boundary. It has a root entity, called the Aggregate Root, which is the only entry point for modifying the aggregate.

_Key points:_

- _Consistency Boundary_: All changes to the aggregate are coordinated to ensure invariants are maintained.
- _Aggregate Root_: Only the root can be referenced from outside; other entities inside the aggregate are accessed via the root.
- _Transaction Scope_: Aggregates are typically the scope of a single transaction.
- _CQRS Role_: Aggregates process commands and generate events, ensuring business rules are enforced before state changes.

_Example:_  
In an e-commerce system, an Order aggregate may include OrderItems, but only the Order (aggregate root) can add or remove items, ensuring the orderâ€™s rules are followed.
